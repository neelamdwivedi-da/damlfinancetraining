# Welcome to the course: Introduction to Daml Finance


This course is an introduction to Daml Finance library with examples, use-cases, quizzes, and hands on exercises to help you learn its fundamental concepts. 

At the end of this course, you will be able to explain the purpose, architecture and design of Daml Finance library. The hands-on exercises will help you develop at least one full working use-case that applies the key learnings from this course. 

To get the best out of this course, you are expected to have completed the Daml Fundamentals training and certification. 

We will begin with two fundamental concepts used in the technical design of the library:

- Daml design patterns
- Daml interfaces 

These two concepts will then enable us to use a series of workflows to understand and explore the key financial as well as technical concepts used in Daml Finance library. These workflows are:

- Transfer: describes accounts, cash instrument, deposits, and transfers
- Settlement: explains how to execute multiple asset movements atomically
- Lifecycling: describes how lifecycle rules and events can be used to evolve instruments over time
